# EY-NextWave-Data-Science-Challenge-2019

The EY NextWave Data Science Challenge 2019 focuses on how data can help the next smart city thrive, and boost the mobility of the future. Global urbanization is on the rise, with more than 50% of the world’s population living in cities; according to the UN, that number will reach 60% by 2030 – that’s nearly 1.5 billion more than in 2010. While this trend creates great opportunities for cities, it also presents challenges to governments on how to upgrade infrastructure, alleviate congestion and address pollution. Electric and autonomous vehicles, along with the explosion of the ride sharing economy, are helping to address these challenges which also disrupt mobility and demand innovative solutions.

In parallel, public authorities have more information than ever on how citizens move around in the city. However, a gap exists between having this data and using it to improve the user travel experience for citizens. Forward-looking authorities have a chance to innovate infrastructure to make their city a better place to live in a better working world.

As a challenge participant, the participant will be able to download a dataset with a vast number of anonymous geolocation records from the US city of Atlanta (Georgia), during October 2018. The task is to produce a model that helps authorities to understand the journeys of citizens while they move in the city throughout the day. If dug deep enough, the work could inspire solutions that help city authorities anticipate disruptions, make real-time decisions, design new services, and reshape infrastructures in order that cities as smart as their citizens.
